**Continuous delivery**

The DevOps trend has given rise to a number of buzzwords and methodologies aiming to speed delivery and accuracy, giving developers the tools they need to deliver better products, with fewer bugs, and implement improvements continuously. Speaking of continuously, you may be familiar with the terms continuous delivery, continuous deployment, and continuous integration. The differences between the three can be confusing, but there are some important distinctions to know.

The Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment (CD) process is a framework that enables this approach. The biggest difference between these stages (CI/CDs) is whom it benefits most at each stage.

CI benefits developers most because it allows for code produced to be automatically tested and continuously “integrated” with other developers’ code, and with the existing codebase. The developer benefits from receiving continuous and immediate feedback regarding code and integration errors.

Continuous Delivery benefits business users because as soon as code is successfully accepted in the CI stage and a logical function can be tested, it is released to users. They verify that the features meet their expectations and provide feedback to developers who then address the feedback in this stage. This feedback loop between users and developers is continuous and seamless.

Continuous Deployment seamlessly pushes code that has been successfully accepted in the CI/CD cycle into the production environment. This stage benefits everybody, from application developers to end-users as new features are available and in a production-ready state.

What are the benefits for continuous delivery?

Top Benefits of Continuous Delivery. Deliver software with fewer bugs and lower risk. When you release smaller changes more frequently, you catch errors much earlier in the development process. When you implement automated testing at every stage of development, you don't pass failed code to the next stage.

What is the difference between continuous integration and continuous delivery?

Continuous delivery is an approach which incorporates the concepts of continuous integration, automated testing and continuous deployment. The difference between continuous delivery and deployment is that business teams may decide not to release software into production with continuous delivery due to various reasons.
