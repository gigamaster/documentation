## Doc Markdown

Overview of the Ecosystem

Read the Docs is the largest open source documentation hosting site in the world. Open Source in this context means both that the code is open source, and the documentation hosted is for open source software. It is a developer focused platform, but it has most of the features that technical writers have come to expect in a tool as well. This blending of worlds makes it the best suited platform for teams that want both writers and developers contributing to product and API documentation.
