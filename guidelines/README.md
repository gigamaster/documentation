**What are Design Guidelines?**

Design guidelines are sets of recommendations towards good practice in design. They are intended to provide clear instructions to designers and developers on how to adopt specific principles, such as intuitiveness, learnability, efficiency, and consistency. Instead of dictating conventions, design guidelines provide helpful advice on how to achieve a design principle that can be platform-specific or cross-platform.

A design guideline (e.g., “text should be easy to read”) sits between a principle in design (e.g., “an interface should be easy to use”) and a standard or rule for implementing it (e.g., “background: white; font-color: black; font-size: 20px”). A design guideline is thus intended to help designers understand how to implement a principle, without restricting their creativity in design, as the commanding inflexibility of a rule might —  Interaction-Design.

#### XCL UI

The <a href="https://xoopscube.github.io/" target="_blank">XCL User Interface Prototype</a> gives everyone an exact idea of which direction to take. The finalized version of the prototype is handed off for development. This is a far more effective way to communicate a design’s intent than a static screenshot. For example, the crafted prototype shows a responsive alternative to a table in HTML, the common layout format for displaying collections of items through a matrix of rows and columns.

#### Layout 

Understanding consistency across platforms and screen sizes by using uniform elements and spacing. Layout guidelines define the overall structure of interface. UI can be designed using grid layout or list layout.

This section of guidelines also contains behavior of responsive design.

**Responsive layout grid**

Design responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation.

#### Components

These guidelines provide specs and usage of UI components that display on interface and a user interacts with them.

UI components include standard controls like input controls, windows, dialogs, panels, menus, views, scrollbars, buttons and many other similar items.

**Navigation**

XCL Navigation enables users to move through an app.

**Search**

XCL Search allows users to quickly find app content

#### Style

Style guidelines define the visual expression of an organization that it presents to the world. Every organization has its own style guide which they use to build logos, colors, icons and typography.

**Color scheme**

Theme color scheme.

**Icons**

Icons used by XCL.

**Typography**

Textual guidelines cover tone and style of text to be used on UI. Text should be understandable for different cultures and audience.

Text specs like font size, color, and style are part of these guidelines. Text displays on UI as fields, labels, messages, and information for user.

#### Interaction

Types of interaction (click, gesture, voice) that a user performs with a design, and system response in return to these interactions are part of these guidelines.

#### Platform

Platforms are changing rapidly where softwares and apps are being developed for mobile, wearable and auto car in addition to conventional desktop systems.

The UI guidelines of an organization cover details of all types of supported platforms and resolutions.

#### Accessibility

Designing an accessible system requires specific set of guidelines for different types of disabled users, so that they can access the design like a normal user.

#### Patterns

Reusable design patterns are included in UI guidelines. These patterns define behavior for certain controls.

Few examples are navigation, search, forms, data formats, states, and pagination.

#### Resources

Guidelines have a collection of resources that can be used while designing a system.

These resources contain layout templates for multiple devices, icon sets, font libraries, UI components and color palettes.

Below is a collection of UI guidelines from few popular organizations that are helpful to make amazing interfaces.
